    <!-- pizza steps-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Make the base</strong>: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. </p>
            <p>Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you
                have a soft, fairly wet dough.</p>

            <p>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.</p>
            <p>Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but itâ€™s not essential
                for
                a thin crust.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Make the sauce</strong>: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to
                taste. </p>
            <p>Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Roll out the dough</strong>: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into
                two balls.</p>
            <p>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.</p>
            <p>The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking
                sheets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Top and bake</strong>: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.</p>
            <p>Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. </p>
            <p>Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive
                oil and season.</p>
            <p>Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.</p>
            <p>Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat
                step for remaining pizza.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
